# redis

Creates a single private Redis node with TLS. Clients must trust the exported certificate; StackExchange.Redis additionally needs a verified TLS server name or certificate validation integration. Do not disable TLS validation.

Provider-specific building block. The caller sets names, sizing and application configuration.
Authentication is inherited from the root provider using `SCW_ACCESS_KEY`, `SCW_SECRET_KEY`
and `SCW_DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_ID`. See `variables.tf` for the complete input contract
and `outputs.tf` for the output contract.
